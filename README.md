This project is an analysis of the risk of male lip cancer in Scotland between 1975 and 1980 by county. It aims to determine whether lip cancer incidence demonstrates spatial dependence, and whether the percentage of the county employed in agriculture, fishing, or forestry has an effect on lip cancer incidence. It was completed to fulfill the requirements for ACMS 60855 Spatio-Temporal Statistics for Environmental Applications at the University of Notre Dame.

The project is contained in FinalExam.R, and can be run by simply executing this one file. Also included in this repository is Milikich-FinalExam.pdf, which is a fuller report on the methodology and conclusions of this analysis.

Running this code requires that the R packages CARBayes, spdep, and grid be installed.

To run the source code, the following should be included in the same directory (included in this repository):
- `lipscotland.RData`

This project was run using R version 4.0.3.
